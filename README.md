-----------

The BenchmARking from Mobidic for Exome sequencing at Nucleotide scale aims to compare recent Whole Exome capture library performance with several items : 
- Coverage of ClinVar pathogenic variants 
- Coverage of gene panel sequencing routine diagnosis
- Coverage of RefSeq Coding regions
- In silico design analysis

# Overview

## Main workflow

For performance benchmark, we use the capture targets bed (and not the empirical or covered bed).
